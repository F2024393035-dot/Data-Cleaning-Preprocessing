# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in Python
This project highlights core data preparation techniques essential for any data science or analytics workflow. It covers theoretical and practical methods to transform messy raw data into a clean, structured format ready for analysis or machine learning.
## 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate how to clean, preprocess, and structure raw data using industry-standard Python libraries, ensuring high-quality datasets for analytics or predictive modeling.
## 🧩 Key Concepts Covered
- **Handling Missing Values**  
  Techniques include removal, mean/median/mode imputation, and forward/backward fill.
- **Detecting and Removing Duplicates**  
  Ensures data integrity by eliminating repeated rows.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**  
  Using IQR, Z-score, or visualization to manage extreme values.
- **Data Type Conversions**  
  Converting columns into correct data types (e.g., strings to datetime, floats to integers).
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
  Applying label encoding or one-hot encoding for non-numeric data.
- **Feature Scaling**  
  Using Min-Max Scaling or Standardization to normalize features for ML models.
- **Renaming and Reformatting Columns**  
  Making column names readable and consistent.
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (for scaling and encoding)
## 💡 Why This Matters
Data cleaning is often said to take up 60–80% of a data professional’s time. A clean dataset ensures:
- Accurate analysis
- Reliable model performance
- Easier collaboration
